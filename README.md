# KeyLogger
Excited to share my first-ever cybersecurity project: a keylogger developed in Python using the pynput library! ðŸŽ‰ As part of my journey to deepen my understanding of cybersecurity, I built this in a controlled virtual environment to explore how such tools work, analyze their behavior, and develop detection/mitigation strategies.

Key takeaways from this project:

Gained hands-on experience with Python programming and system monitoring.
Learned to simulate and analyze malicious software behavior ethically.
Created a detection script to identify keylogger activity, enhancing my defensive skills.
This was a safe, educational exercise conducted solely on my own systems, with a focus on understanding threats to better protect against them.
